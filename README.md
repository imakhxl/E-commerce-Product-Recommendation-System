# E-commerce-Product-Recommendation-System
An E-Commerce Product Recommendation Project which takes on 3 approaches to the solution. It involves Singular Value Decomposition, Correlation and k-Means Clustering algorithms.

The recommendation system is designed in 3 parts based on the business context:

Recommendation system part I: Product popularity based system targetted at new customers

Recommendation system part II: Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought items similar items

Recommendation system part III: When a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time withou any product rating

When a new customer without any previous purchase history visits the e-commerce website for the first time, he/she is recommended the most popular products sold on the company's website. Once, he/she makes a purchase, the recommendation system updates and recommends other products based on the purchase history and ratings provided by other users on the website. The latter part is done using collaborative filtering techniques.
